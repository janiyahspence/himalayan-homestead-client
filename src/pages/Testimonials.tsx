    review: `We had a truly memorable stay at Himalayan Homevalley Homestead, Palampur. We were two families (8 members) and had booked four rooms. From the moment we arrived, we felt completely at home.

The homestay is calm, serene, and beautifully surrounded by the majestic Dhauladhar ranges. The peaceful environment and natural beauty made our stay very relaxing.

The food was excellent—very tasty, freshly prepared, and hygienic. Every meal added warmth to our experience.

Lalita Ranaji and her husband Raj ji are extremely warm, caring, and hospitable hosts. Their personal attention and genuine kindness made us feel like part of the family. The place is filled with positive vibes.

This was more than just a stay—it was a beautiful experience we will cherish. We would love to visit again and highly recommend this homestay to anyone seeking comfort, peace, and heartfelt hospitality in nature.`,

    review: `Had an amazing stay at this beautiful property in Palampur with my family! The hosts Lalita Ma'am and Raj Sir were extremely warm, welcoming, and helpful throughout our time there. The property is spacious, well-maintained, and perfect for a big group — it easily accommodated our family of 14 people.

The rooms were large and comfortable, and the kitchen was fully equipped, which made everything super convenient. We had initially planned to stay for just one day, but we loved it so much that we extended it to two days.

One of the highlights was the delicious, fresh home-cooked food — especially the pudina chutney, which was absolutely amazing!

The hosts also gave us some great recommendations for local sightseeing, which really added to the experience.

Highly recommend this place if you're planning a trip to Palampur with family or a group!`,

Helped us through everything including parking, providing additional necessities, made us feel super comfortable.

We were a family of 6 and the property can easily accommodate 10-12 paxs. Amazing views from rooftop and balcony.`,

    review: `I had an amazing stay here! The place was exceptionally clean and well-kept, which made it really comfortable and relaxing. What stood out even more was the warmth and hospitality of the uncle and aunty – they were so kind, friendly, and always ready to help. It truly felt like a home away from home.

The food was another highlight – absolutely delicious, homemade, and full of flavor. Every meal felt like it was made with love. I would definitely recommend this stay to anyone looking for a clean, cozy, and heartwarming experience.`,

The food was fresh and tasty. The property was clean with all the amenities. Lalita ji is very fond of flowers, and oh, we loved them! Such beautiful landscapes.

Recommend this stay to individuals and families.`,
